## Problem/Motivation

We understand the frustration of having a single ingredient and not knowing what to make with it. That's why Food for thought is here to save the day! Our platform aims to address the common problem of incomplete recipes by providing a list of delectable options that you can whip up using the ingredient you have on hand. Additionally, we make it convenient for you by showing nearby grocery stores where you can purchase any additional items you might need.

## How Recipe Finder Addresses the Problem

Food For Thought offers a simple and intuitive interface to streamline your recipe search process. Here's how it works:

1.Ingredient Selection: Start by entering the single ingredient you have. It could be anything from a vegetable to a protein, a pantry staple to a unique spice. Our advanced algorithms will process your selection and generate a range of recipe options that incorporate your chosen ingredient.

2.Recipe Options: Once you've submitted your ingredient, Recipe Finder will display a curated list of recipes that make the most of your selection. Each recipe comes with a captivating image, a tantalizing description, and a list of required ingredients (including your selected ingredient). You'll also find detailed step-by-step instructions on how to prepare each dish.

3.Grocery Store Locator: Alongside the recipes, we provide a helpful map feature that shows nearby grocery stores in your area. This way, you can quickly find the closest location to pick up any missing ingredients and start cooking right away.
